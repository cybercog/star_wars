Total Buff Power
 
Heal Power of Pack x Environment x [(100 + Wound Treatment Skill + Bivoli + BE modded clothes) / 100] x Med City Bonus
 
for example:
900 Heal Power Buff pack
110 Medical Rating Droid
100 Master Doctor Skill
25 Bivoli
25 BE clothes
10% Medical City Specialization Bonus
 
900 x 1.1 x [(100+100+25+25)/100] x 1.1 = 2722 total buff
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now how Battle Fatigue affects this...
 
If player Battle Fatigue is 0 - 250 = no change in buff value.
 
If player Battle Fatigue is greater than 250 then...
 
Buff - [Buff x (Battle Fatigue-250) / 1000] = Buff after Battle Fatigue
 
so with 696 Battle Fatigue (Randomly chosen number)
 
2722 - [ 2722 x (696 - 250) / 1000] = 1507 buffed after 696 Battle Fatigue
 
Helpful Notes:
 
 
* Wearing armor does NOT affect buff power.
* Bio-engineered clothes effectively cap at +25/+25 so a person with +9999/ +9999 will do the SAME as one with only +25/+25 injury/wound treatment clothes.
* Bivoli DOES STACK with BE clothes.
* Battle Fatigue does NOT affect buff performance until 250 Battle Fatigue. One could have 249 Battle Fatigue and it will be the same as one with 0 Battle Fatigue.
* Battle Fatigue after 250 - affects the buff performance by 1% per 10 Battle Fatigue.
* At 1000 Battle Fatigue (when Battle Fatigue caps) buff performance is reduced by 75%.
* At 750 Battle Fatigue buff performance is reduced by 50%.
* At 500 Battle Fatigue buff performance is reduced by 25%.
* General Equation for Master Doctor with 110 Med Module Droid and 25/25 BE clothes : Buff Pack Power x 2.475 = total heal enhance.
* Medical centers and scout camps override droid bonuses.
* If not in a Medical Specialized Player City - the variable is calculated at 1.0.
* If in a Medical Specialized Player City - the varible is calculated at 1.1.
* Wound Treatment Speed are at a minimum of 18 seconds at Master Doctor.
* Wound Treatment Speed can be affected by consuming Ruby Bliel or Havla.

That's everything that affects buffing. Pick whatever species you'd like to play monk :)
