Attack: Standard Melee Attack
Macro Name: /attack
Chat Name: “swings at”
Damage Multiplier: Listed weapon damage x 1.86 (Standard Fencer Multiplier, and is applied to ALL Fencer attacks in addition to the listed multiplier.)
Info: This is the damage done when not performing any specials.  It is the damage that will appear in the combat chat box, and does not include any reductions due to the target’s defenses.  It will randomly target any HAM pool, but appears to have a slight preference towards the Health Pool (about 40-50% of the attacks hit Health, 20-30% Action, and 20-30% Mind.)

Attack: BlindHit1
Macro Name: /melee1hBlindHit1
Chat Name: “Blinding Stab”
Damage Multiplier: x 2.0
Target: Single
Effect: Blind (White “eye” icon on the target.)
Info: Blind status significantly reduces the target’s accuracy, melee defense, and ranged defense.  Duration is a 5 second minimum, but is random and varies based upon the target’s Defense Vs. Blind.

Attack: BlindHit2
Macro Name: /melee1hBlindHit2
Chat Name: “Blinding Slash”
Damage Multiplier: x 2.5
Target: All in range
Effect: Blind (White “eye” icon on the target.)
Info: This is the same effect as bestowed in BlindHit1, and is no more potent.  The only difference is that this is a multiple target area attack.  All targets in weapon range will be attacked, however a valid target must be chosen for the attack to work at all.

Attack: BodyHit1
Macro Name: /melee1hBodyHit1
Chat Name: “Sai Mai”
Damage Multiplier: x 1.5
Target: Single
Effect: Targets Health Pool
Info: This is an efficiency attack.  All of the damage is applied directly to the Health Pool every time, rather than randomly across the 3 HAM bars.

Attack: BodyHit2
Macro Name: /melee1hBodyHit2
Chat Name: “Sai Sun”
Damage Multiplier: x 2.5
Target: Single
Effect: Targets Health Pool
Info: Same as BodyHit1.

Attack: BodyHit3
Macro Name: /melee1hBodyHit3
Chat Name: “Sai Tok”
Damage Multiplier: x 3.5
Target: Single
Effect: Targets Health Pool
Info: Same as BodyHit1.

Attack: DizzyHit1
Macro Name: /melee1hDizzyHit1
Chat Name: “Skull Stab”
Damage Multiplier: x 2.0
Target: Single
Effect: Dizzy (White “whirlwind” icon on target.)
Info: By itself this effect does nothing.  However, if the target attempts an upward posture change while Dizzy, they can potentially suffer a “Fall Down”.  The effects of a “Fall Down” are identical to those of a Knockdown, except that it doesn’t count against the delay timer as a Knockdown.  Duration of Dizzy is a 5 second minimum, but is random and varies based upon the target’s Defense Vs. Dizzy.
Special Info:  This is designed to be combined with the Novice Brawler “Lunge1” attack to force a posture down (which usually inspires the target to attempt to “get back up”), or a regular Knockdown.

Attack: DizzyHit2
Macro Name: /melee1hDizzyHit2
Chat Name: “Skull Slash”
Damage Multiplier: x 3.5
Target: All in range
Effect: Dizzy (White “whirlwind” icon on target.)
Info: This is the same effect as bestowed in DizzyHit1, and is no more potent.  The only difference is that this is a multiple target area attack.  All targets in weapon range will be attacked, however a valid target must be chosen for the attack to work at all.

Attack: HealthHit1
Macro Name: /melee1hHealthHit1
Chat Name: “Shiim”
Damage Multiplier: x 1.5
Target: Single
Effect: Bleeding and Wounding (Red “droplets” icon on target.), Target’s Health Pool
Info: This is an efficiency attack.  This attack produces two consequences.  The first, but least significant, is the high probability of infliction of Wounds in the target’s Health Pool.  The primary effect is that of Bleeding, which drains the Health Pool over time.  The damage listed in chat is the amount of the Bleed established, but the attack itself does NO immediate damage.  15 seconds after the attack, the indicated damage is automatically deducted from the target’s Health pool, and again every 15 seconds after.  This will continue whether you are fighting, incapacitated, or dead.  The Bleeding will stop on its own after 10 cycles.  First Aid and Meditation can remedy Bleeding sooner.
Special Info: HealthHit1 stacks with HealthHit2, HealthShot1, and HealthShot2 with each on their own timers.  Multiple hits with HealthHit1 are NOT cumulative, and do NOT reset the timer unless the damage is higher than the current HealthHit1.
